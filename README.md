# Nuclear Energy Generation Prediction Logistic Regression

Nuclear Energy Generation Prediction Logistic Regression project is aimed at predicting the nuclear energy generation based on the production (generation) data from 1991 to 2023 by using Logistic Regression. This is a beginner-friendly notebook that assists in understanding the prediction curve of nuclear power generation using Logictic Regression.

### A Note about Logistic Regression:

Logictic Regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm that gets trained on real-world data and it tries to predict or forecast results depending on its training. Logistic regression is used in various fields, including machine learning, mathematics, economics, most of the medical fields and science branches.
